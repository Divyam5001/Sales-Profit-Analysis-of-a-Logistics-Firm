# Sales-Profit-Analysis-of-a-Logistics-Firm using Advanced Excel
This project provides an in-depth analysis of a logistics firm's sales, revenue, and profitability.

This project was built using Advanced Excel and Pivot Tables to get a clear picture of how a logistics firm is performing. 
The dashboard breaks down key metrics like sales, profit, logistics costs, and revenue, making it easy to spot trends over time. 
It also dives into monthly sales vs. profit patterns, segment-wise performance, and category contributions, helping to understand whatâ€™s driving the business. 
Plus, with sales by state, top-selling subcategories, and order details by region and shipping mode, it provides a well-rounded view for smarter decision-making.
